### A study on cooperation in virtual reality (Oculus Quest Side)

This is the code repository for an experiment developed during my end-of-studies internship, at the Mediterranean Virtual Reality Center. The experimentation code belongs to my internship manager Jean-Marie Pergandi: jean-marie.pergandi@univ-amu.fr

My internship was carried out at the Institute of Movement Sciences, in Luminy, at the University of Aix-Marseille: https://ism.univ-amu.fr

This experiment is the transcription, in virtual reality, of a study carried out on the collaboration by the Behavioral Dynamics and Immersion team (at the Institute of Movement Sciences, Luminy).

This code is a piece of experimentation, made to work under the Oculus Quest. It uses the Unet API to work on the network. This version for Quest acts like a client: it only responsibilities are to move the racket to catch the ball.

The development of this experiment is not complete:
* The data recording is not 100% reliable
* The conduct of the experiment must be reviewed
* The network implementation lacks flexibility: for the moment, the IP address must be manually entered by hand within Unity
